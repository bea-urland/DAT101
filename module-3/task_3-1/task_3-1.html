      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When the wake-up time exactly 7, you can take the bus to school. Otherwise, you need to take the car to school.]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When the wake-up time is not 7, but 8, you can take the train to school. Otherwise, you need to take the car. When it's exactly 7, you can catch the bus.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[When you wake up earlier than 7 or greater than 8, you need to take the car to school. ]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
    </ol>[0 is neither negative or positive, it is considered as neutral. Anything less than zero is negative and anything greater than 0 is positive.]
