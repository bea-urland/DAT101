      <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[Yes, it is because even though there’s only one loop, it’s doing two things at the same time — counting forward and backward.]</p>
      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
your answer]</li>
      <p>[You could have an 'infinite' loop within the condition of the 'while' loop if the condition is always true and can never be false. This isn't difficult to create, however, you must also have exit strategies to not freeze up the program.  For instance, you could have async loops that yield control, and always include an exit strategy or safety limit or safety limit for repeated work.]</p>
      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>[The computer can guess very quickly, but because it's guessing randomly, it can take some time. While it’s guessing, the program can't perform other tasks since JavaScript runs on a single thread and while the loop runs, it can freeze the program.]</p>
      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
matter?]</li>
      <p>[In nested for loops, one loop controls the rows and the other controls the columns, creating a grid-like structure. You can switch their order, but it changes how the output is arranged — which loop is outer or inner determines whether rows or columns are printed first.]</p>
